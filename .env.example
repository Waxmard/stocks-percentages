# Stock Allocation Tool Configuration
# This file serves as a template and documentation for the .env file used by the stock allocation tool.
# Copy this file to .env and adjust the values according to your preferences.

# Stock Lists
# Define your stock portfolios here. Each list is a comma-separated string of stock symbols.
# You can modify these lists to include any stocks you're interested in.

# Motley Fool-inspired stock list
MOTLEY_STOCKS=CRWD,KNSL,TTD,ABNB,SHOP,MELI,SNOW,CHWY,TSLA

# TED-inspired stock list
TED_STOCKS=CAVA,TMDX,ARM,AMZN,CRWD,META

# Personal stock list
ME_STOCKS=SNOW,AMZN,IBM,SMCI,NVIDIA,MU,AMD,ARM

# Portfolio Allocations
# Define the percentage allocation for each stock list. These should sum to 100.
# Adjust these values to change the weight of each stock list in your overall portfolio.

# Percentage allocated to Motley Fool-inspired stocks (0-100)
MOTLEY_ALLOCATION=55

# Percentage allocated to TED-inspired stocks (0-100)
TED_ALLOCATION=35

# Percentage allocated to personal stock picks (0-100)
ME_ALLOCATION=10

# Other Constants

# Total amount to invest in dollars
# This sets the total size of your portfolio in USD
TOTAL_AMOUNT=7000

# Geometric ratio for stock allocation within each list (0-1)
# This determines how quickly the allocation decreases for each subsequent stock in a list.
# A higher value (closer to 1) results in a more even distribution.
# A lower value (closer to 0) heavily favors the top stocks in each list.
GEOMETRIC_RATIO=0.85

# Maximum number of stocks to include in the final allocation
# Set to 0 for no limit. This helps to focus your portfolio on your top picks.
# A lower number will result in a more concentrated portfolio.
STOCK_LIMIT=10

# Minimum dollar amount for any single stock allocation
# Stocks that would be allocated less than this amount will be removed from the final allocation.
# Set to 0 for no minimum. This helps to avoid very small positions in your portfolio.
# Note: Setting this too high might result in fewer stocks than your STOCK_LIMIT.
MIN_DOLLAR_AMOUNT=500

# Note on STOCK_LIMIT and MIN_DOLLAR_AMOUNT interaction:
# The script will attempt to meet both the STOCK_LIMIT and MIN_DOLLAR_AMOUNT requirements.
# If it's not possible to meet both, it will prioritize the MIN_DOLLAR_AMOUNT,
# which may result in fewer stocks than specified by STOCK_LIMIT.
# If no combination can meet the MIN_DOLLAR_AMOUNT for multiple stocks,
# the script will allocate 100% to the top stock.
